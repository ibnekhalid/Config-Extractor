ðŸš€ Automating EF Core Configurations with Roslyn ðŸš€

Working with large Entity Framework Core DbContexts can make configurations hard to track, especially with numerous entities. I recently created a tool using Roslyn to automate the extraction of EF Core configurations into separate files. Hereâ€™s how it works and a sample of the code:

ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Process:

1. Parsing the DbContext: Using Roslyn, the tool identifies the OnModelCreating method and finds all modelBuilder.Entity<> invocations.
2. Extracting Configurations: For each entity, the tool gathers important configurations like .ToTable(), .HasForeignKey(), etc.
3. Generating Configuration Classes: It creates an IEntityTypeConfiguration<T> class for each entity and writes it to a designated folder.
4. Formatting: Using Roslynâ€™s Formatter, the tool ensures the generated code is clean and well-structured.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Approach? This tool keeps DbContext configurations organized, reduces clutter, and makes managing configurations easier. Tools like Roslyn allow powerful analysis and code generation, paving the way for automation in .NET development. ðŸš€
